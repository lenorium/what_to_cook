# Recipe Chooser

Yeah, one more app with recipes. Then why did I create it?

The main reason is that almost every morning we have to come up with breakfast 
ideas before weâ€™ve even had coffee. Sometimes it can feel like a really tall order and annoying.
Using this app you can just save all your recipes, 
and every time you need an idea the app will choose it for you.

The second reason is that I need to practice Python.
