# Recipe Chooser

Yeah, one more app with recipes. Then why did I create it?

*Reason 1*. It's going to help you in making a decision. Almost every morning we have to come up with breakfast 
ideas before weâ€™ve even had coffee. Sometimes it can feel like a really tall order and annoying.
Using this app you can just save all your recipes, 
and every time you need an idea the app will choose it for you.

*Reason 2*. I need to practice Python.
